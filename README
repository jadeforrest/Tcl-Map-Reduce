Simple implementation of the Map Reduce algorithm. This is 
an algorithm is very scalable. Use of it is well advised
for any time a problem can be easily divided. For example,
any time we are doing an operation on each element of a list
or each element of an array.

Functional programming initially looks very confusing. Read up on it in 
Wikipedia or other sources until this code makes sense. Also read the Joel
on Software piece below.
